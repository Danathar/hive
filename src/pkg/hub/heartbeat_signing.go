// least one each call, so the sequence is monotonic across the process lifetime
// AND (because a restarted hub reseeds from a later wall-clock time) does not
// regress across a hub restart under normal clock conditions — a spoke's
// rollback floor therefore keeps advancing. A per-hive map keeps one hive's
// counter from being perturbed by another's beat rate.

// signHeartbeatResponse fills the response's authenticated binding fields

// header over the resulting body bytes.
//
// FAIL-OPEN BY DESIGN, and only in the one safe direction: a hub with no signing
// seed (no master secret configured) emits an UNSIGNED response, exactly as it
// did before this change. Spokes accept unsigned responses until they have seen
// a signed one (pkg/spoke trust-on-first-signed), so a keyless hub does not
// brick anyone. A hub WITH a seed always signs, so once a spoke has seen one
// signed response it can enforce.
//
// It is called with the SAME resp that is about to be marshalled to the wire,
// and it marshals resp once here to sign the exact bytes; the caller marshals
// again to write. The two marshals are byte-identical (same struct, same
// process), so the signature covers what the spoke receives.

// publishRuntimeUIDIsolationMarker publishes the per-agent completion marker
// for an agent whose UID was allocated at RUNTIME (AddAgent/ReconcileAgents),
// after the entrypoint's boot-time migration walk has already finished. The
// walk only iterates the boot-time roster, so without this an agent added
// post-boot waits in awaitUIDIsolation for an agent-<uid>.ready marker that
// nothing will ever write — a permanent launch hold (observed live: an ACMM
// pack update added `adjudicator` 31 minutes after boot and every governor
// kick failed with "cannot be kicked: it is stopped" from then on).
//
// Semantics mirror the entrypoint's per-agent pass, including its fail-open
// policy: a runtime-added agent normally has NO tree yet under /data/agents
// (it is created at launch, owned by the launching UID), so there is nothing
// to migrate and publishing the marker is the correct, safe resolution. When
// a tree does exist and is foreign-owned, the entrypoint publishes after a
// best-effort chown WARN — withholding the marker forever would turn a
// permissions warning into a permanent agent outage, which is exactly the
// failure this fixes. The hive process cannot chown (it dropped root), so the
// ownership repair half is left to the next boot's walk; the marker unblocks
// launch under the same fail-open contract.
//
// Never overwrites a marker that already carries the expected contents, and
// does nothing on legacy deployments with no marker contract.
